## Introduction

Tests form an essential part of a codebase. They arise together with the code
they test, born to be a loyal companion, a compassionate shepherd, allowing the
code to explore its design space, to develop its character, while keeping it
from error and harm.

At their best tests deliver insight and confidence. A system that isn't tested
could do anything, or nothing. It could be broken in any number of ways. Nothing
can be asserted about such a system, it is shrouded in darkness.
