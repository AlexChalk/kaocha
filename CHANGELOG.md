# 7b79fad92d (2018-06-16)

## Added

- The profiling plugin can now be configured on the command line and from
  tests.edn, with `--[no-]profiling`, `--profiling-count`,
  `:kaocha.plugin.profiling/profiling?`, `:kaocha.plugin.profiling/count`

## Changed

- `--focus` and `--focus-meta` override config-level `:focus`/`:focus-meta`,
  rather than append. This is more intuitive, when focusing from the command
  line you don't want extra tests to show up.
- Don't run the `post-summary` hook when using the API, this prevents noise from
  plugins in the `--print-test-plan` / `--print-result` output.

## Fixed

- Don't count filtered tests in profiling results.

# 8eeff5b340 (2018-06-13)

## Added

- Testable now has an optional `:kaocha.var/wrap` key, which can contain a seq
  of functions that will be used to "wrap" the actual test function, useful e.g.
  for providing bindings. clojure.test style :each fixtures are also handled
  through this key, so plugins can choose to add wrapping functions at the start
  or the end of this seq to wrap "inside" or "around" the fixtures.

# 9a920204bc (2018-06-13)

## Changed

- Make the test-plan available in `pre-test` and `post-test` plugin hooks, so
  that they have access to top level configuration items.

# 3319ed6f81 (2018-06-13)

## Added

- Added the `kaocha.plugin/defplugin` macro, making plugins look more like a
  deftype.

# 9a6fa32592 (2018-06-02)

## Changed

- The configuration format has changed, you should now start with the `#kaocha
  {}` tagged reader literal in `tests.edn` to provide defaults. If you want more
  control then overwrite `tests.edn` with the output of `--print-config` and
  tweak.
